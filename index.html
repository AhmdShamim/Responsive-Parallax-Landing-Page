        <p><span class="first-character sc">A</span>web application firewall (WAF) is a type of security system that filters and monitors incoming traffic to a website or web application. Its purpose is to block malicious traffic, such as hackers and bots, while allowing legitimate traffic through. In other words, a WAF is like a security guard for your website. It checks the identity of each visitor to makes sure they are who they say they are and that they aren't trying to do anything malicious. WAFs can be either hardware- or software-based. They are usually deployed as an additional layer between your website and the Internet so they can intercept and inspect traffic before it reaches your site.

        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">Most WAFs use a set of directives, also known as a rule set, to determine which traffic they allow through or block. These rules are generally created by the WAF vendor based on common attack patterns. Some WAFs also allow you to create custom rules. A WAF is different from a network firewall in that is is meant to specifically protect web applications. Network firewalls, on the other hand, aim to protect entire networks and can be either hardware- or software-based. While both types of firewalls can filter traffic, a WAF is more comprehensive in that it can also monitor and inspect web traffic for malicious activity. It can also block specific types of attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
